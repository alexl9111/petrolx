## 1. Introduction

PETROLX (PTX) is a utility token designed to support faster, cheaper, and more transparent digital transactions within the energy and petroleum trading ecosystem.

The project starts as a lightweight blockchain utility token and aims to evolve into a professional B2B infrastructure layer for energy-related settlements, payments, and service access.

PETROLX does **not** represent ownership of physical oil and is **not** a stablecoin in its first phase.
